- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. (Created template per instructions.)

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Requirements specified: Node.js + TypeScript Monzo crawler brief.)

- [x] Scaffold the Project (Manual Node.js + TypeScript structure created via workspace tools.)

- [x] Customize the Project (Implemented crawler modules, CLI, normalization, and tests.)

- [x] Install Required Extensions (No additional extensions required.)

- [x] Compile the Project (npm run build && npm test confirm clean build and passing suite.)

- [x] Create and Run Task (No VS Code tasks needed for this workflow.)

- [x] Launch the Project (Crawler CLI executed with Node 22 runtime.)

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README.md and copilot-instructions.md verified current.)

Execution Guidelines
- Progress tracking: After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary. Read the current checklist status before starting a new step.
- Communication: Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs. If a step is skipped, state that briefly. Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Development: Use '.' as the working directory unless specified otherwise. Avoid adding media or external links unless requested. Use placeholders only when noted. Use the VS Code API tool only for extension projects.
- Folder creation: Treat the current directory as the project root. Only create new folders when explicitly requested. Ensure commands operate on the current directory.
- Extension installation: Install only extensions specified by get_project_setup_info.
- Project content: Assume "Hello World" if no project details are provided. Avoid unnecessary links or media. Confirm assumptions with the user when in doubt.
- Task completion: The task is complete when the project builds cleanly, tests pass, README.md is current, and launch instructions are documented for the user.
